2. **Line 11:** Changed unneccessary div class header to simply "header"

4. **Line 25:** Changed "div" to "section" for accessibility
5. **Line 26:** Changed "class" to "id" so that the link will redirect to the correct section on the webpage

## CSS Changes
Changed the order of the CSS elements to a logical structure that follows the structure of the webpage and HTML.
1. **Line 27/35/39:** Changed "div" to "nav" to coordinate with HTMl
2. **Line 78/87/91:** Changed attribute names to ".services" to coordinate with HTML and removed repetative code that was condensed to 1 attribute

4. **Lines 123/130:** Changed ".footer" to "footer" because it is no longer a class, and needs to coordinate with HTML
